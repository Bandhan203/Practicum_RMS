## Chapter 3. Requirement Engineering

Requirement engineering is the backbone of any successful software project, as it ensures that the system meets the true needs of its users while adhering to operational and industry standards. For complex restaurant management systems like Smart Dine POS, requirement engineering is crucial because it defines the workflows for user management, daily restaurant operations, order processing, inventory management, billing, and comprehensive reporting. A well-executed requirement engineering phase minimizes errors, reduces development costs, and ensures compliance with restaurant industry best practices and food service regulations.

This chapter details the requirement elicitation, analysis, specification, and use case modeling of the Smart Dine POS System. Each section provides practical insights and real-world scenarios to illustrate actual restaurant operational requirements.

### 3.1 Requirement Elicitation of Smart Dine POS

Requirement elicitation involves discovering and gathering system needs from stakeholders to understand what the system must accomplish to support efficient restaurant operations. Unlike simple interviews, elicitation involves multiple techniques to capture explicit requirements (stated by users), implicit requirements (assumed by users), and regulatory requirements (mandated by health departments and business regulations). In the Smart Dine POS system, failure to capture essential requirements—such as secure order processing or accurate inventory tracking—can lead to operational disruptions and financial losses.

#### 3.1.1 Stakeholder Identification

Proper identification of stakeholders ensures no critical perspective is overlooked in restaurant management system development. For the Smart Dine POS, key stakeholders include:

3. **Chefs/Kitchen Staff** – Receive and process orders, update order status, manage kitchen workflows, and track ingredient usage
4. **Waiters/Service Staff** – Take customer orders, process payments, handle customer requests, and manage table assignments
5. **Customers** – Place orders, make payments, view order status, and provide feedback on service
6. **Restaurant Owners** – Access comprehensive business analytics, financial reports, and strategic performance indicators
7. **Suppliers** – Receive inventory orders and delivery confirmations (future integration)
8. **System (Automated Actor)** – Performs automated backups, generates scheduled reports, sends notifications, and maintains data consistency

**Humanizing the perspective:** A restaurant manager described their daily challenge: "Without proper workflow for order tracking, inventory alerts, and real-time sales reporting, our restaurant operations become chaotic during peak hours, leading to customer dissatisfaction and lost revenue." Capturing such insights is vital for accurate requirement definition.

#### 3.1.2 Techniques Used for Elicitation

A combination of elicitation techniques was applied to ensure comprehensive requirement gathering:

## Chapter 5. Project Management

Effective project management is crucial for the success of any software development initiative. For a complex system like the Smart Dine POS System, which manages user authentication, menu management, order processing, inventory control, billing, and comprehensive analytics, risk management plays a vital role. Risks can arise from technical challenges, operational complexities, or business requirements changes. Proper identification, assessment, and mitigation of these risks ensure the project progresses smoothly, meets deadlines, and fulfills stakeholder expectations while maintaining high quality standards.

This chapter elaborates on risk management strategies, risk categories, stages of risk management, and the comprehensive RMMM (Risk Mitigation, Monitoring, and Management) plan for the Smart Dine POS project. The chapter provides detailed analysis of different types of risks with their probability assessments, impact evaluations, and specific mitigation strategies.

### 5.1 Risk Management

Risk management is the systematic process of identifying, analyzing, and responding to project risks to minimize negative impacts on project objectives while maximizing opportunities for success. In restaurant management software projects, risks can be technical (system performance, integration challenges), operational (user adoption, workflow disruption), financial (budget overruns, ROI concerns), or organizational (staff resistance, management support). The goal is not to eliminate all risks but to anticipate and plan for potential issues, ensuring the development team can respond effectively when risks materialize, maintaining project momentum and quality standards.

#### 5.1.1 Stages of Risk Management

The risk management process for the Smart Dine POS system follows a structured approach divided into several systematic stages:

**Risk Identification Stage:**
This initial stage involves recognizing potential risks that could affect project success. For the Smart Dine POS system, risks may include system performance issues during peak restaurant hours, data inconsistency between frontend and backend systems, errors in order processing that could affect customer satisfaction, integration challenges with existing restaurant equipment, or staff resistance to new technology adoption. Techniques used include stakeholder brainstorming sessions, historical project data analysis from similar restaurant systems, expert judgment from restaurant industry professionals, and checklist-based identification using software development risk templates.

Example: During planning, the team identified that real-time order synchronization between kitchen displays and service staff tablets could fail during network interruptions, potentially causing order confusion and customer dissatisfaction.

**Risk Analysis and Assessment Stage:**
Each identified risk is analyzed systematically to determine its likelihood of occurrence and potential impact on project scope, schedule, cost, and quality. Risks are classified using a standard matrix approach with probability ratings (Low: 0-30%, Medium: 31-70%, High: 71-100%) and impact severity (Low: minimal effect, Medium: moderate disruption, High: significant project impact, Critical: project failure potential).

Example: A database server failure during peak dinner service is considered high impact due to its potential to completely halt restaurant operations, affect customer service, and cause revenue loss, even though the probability might be relatively low with proper infrastructure.

**Risk Prioritization Stage:**
Risks are prioritized using risk exposure calculations (Probability × Impact) to ensure high-priority risks receive immediate attention and resource allocation. Risk matrices and heat maps help visualize priorities and guide resource allocation decisions.

Example: Technical risks like API integration failures with payment gateways were ranked higher than minor user interface usability issues because payment processing is critical for restaurant operations.

**Risk Response Planning Stage:**
This stage involves determining specific strategies for each significant risk. Four primary response strategies are employed:
- **Avoid:** Eliminate risk by changing project approach or requirements
- **Mitigate:** Reduce probability or impact through preventive measures
- **Transfer:** Shift risk to third parties through contracts or insurance
- **Accept:** Acknowledge risk and plan contingency responses

Example: To mitigate the risk of data loss during system failures, automated backup processes every 15 minutes were implemented, along with redundant database servers and disaster recovery procedures.

**Risk Monitoring and Control Stage:**
Continuous monitoring ensures new risks are identified promptly and existing risks are tracked throughout the project lifecycle. Weekly risk assessment meetings, automated monitoring dashboards, and regular stakeholder feedback sessions provide ongoing risk visibility and enable proactive management responses.

#### 5.1.2 Categories of Risk in Smart Dine POS Project

**Technical Risks:**
These risks relate to technology implementation, system performance, and integration challenges:
- System downtime during peak restaurant operations due to server overload or network failures
- Database performance degradation with large volumes of orders and inventory transactions
- Integration failures with external systems (payment gateways, kitchen equipment, accounting software)
- Security vulnerabilities in user authentication or financial transaction processing
- Mobile device compatibility issues affecting tablet-based order entry
- Real-time synchronization failures between different system components

**Business Risks:**
These risks affect business objectives, market positioning, and organizational goals:
- Non-compliance with restaurant industry regulations or food service standards
- Budget overruns due to scope creep or extended development timelines
- Delayed restaurant deployment affecting competitive positioning and revenue
- Changes in restaurant industry standards or customer expectations during development
- Inadequate return on investment due to lower-than-expected efficiency gains
- Market competition from established POS system providers

**Operational Risks:**
These risks impact day-to-day project execution and restaurant operations:
- Staff resistance to new technology adoption requiring extensive change management
- Inadequate user training leading to system misuse and operational inefficiencies
- Data migration errors from existing systems causing information loss or corruption
- Workflow disruption during system implementation affecting restaurant service quality
- Insufficient technical support during go-live causing operational problems
- Hardware failures or compatibility issues with existing restaurant equipment

**Organizational Risks:**
These risks relate to project team, stakeholder management, and organizational factors:
- Key team member departure causing knowledge loss and project delays
- Inadequate stakeholder communication leading to requirement misunderstandings
- Insufficient management support for project implementation and staff training
- Resource conflicts with other organizational priorities and projects
- Cultural resistance to digital transformation within traditional restaurant operations

### 5.2 The RMMM Plan

The RMMM (Risk Mitigation, Monitoring, and Management) plan provides a comprehensive framework for handling each identified risk throughout the Smart Dine POS project lifecycle. This plan ensures risks are addressed proactively rather than reactively, with clear responsibilities, timelines, and success metrics.

**Risk Mitigation Strategies:**
Systematic measures designed to reduce the probability of risk occurrence or minimize impact when risks materialize:
- **Technical Mitigation:** Implementing robust system architecture with redundancy, automated testing procedures, and comprehensive error handling
- **Process Mitigation:** Establishing clear development methodologies, regular code reviews, and iterative testing cycles
- **Training Mitigation:** Providing comprehensive user training programs, documentation, and ongoing support systems

Example: To mitigate integration risks with payment gateways, the team implemented comprehensive API testing environments, fallback payment processing methods, and real-time transaction monitoring systems.

**Risk Monitoring Procedures:**
Continuous observation and measurement systems to detect early warning signs of risk occurrence:
- **Automated Monitoring:** System performance dashboards, error logging systems, and automated alert mechanisms
- **Manual Monitoring:** Weekly project reviews, stakeholder feedback sessions, and regular system audits
- **Performance Metrics:** Key performance indicators tracking system reliability, user adoption rates, and operational efficiency

Example: Daily monitoring of system response times during peak restaurant hours ensures performance issues are detected and addressed before they impact customer service.

**Risk Management Protocols:**
Structured processes for responding when risks materialize, including escalation procedures and corrective actions:
- **Incident Response:** Clear procedures for addressing system failures, data breaches, or operational disruptions
- **Communication Plans:** Stakeholder notification procedures and status reporting protocols
- **Recovery Procedures:** Backup system activation, data recovery processes, and service restoration timelines

Example: If the primary database server fails during restaurant operations, automatic failover to backup servers occurs within 30 seconds, management is notified immediately, and full system recovery procedures are initiated.

TCF = 0.65 + (0.01 × 53) = 0.65 + 0.53 = 1.18

**Adjusted Function Points (AFP) = UFP × TCF**
AFP = 135 × 1.18 = 159.3 ≈ 159 Function Points

#### 6.1.8 Effort and Schedule Estimation

**Development Effort Calculation:**
Using industry-standard productivity rates for web application development:
- React.js/Laravel productivity: 8.5 hours per Function Point
- Total effort = 159 FP × 8.5 hours = 1,351.5 person-hours

**Project Duration Calculation:**
- Person-days = 1,351.5 ÷ 8 hours = 168.9 ≈ 169 person-days
- Calendar days (with team of 4 developers) = 169 ÷ 4 = 42.25 ≈ 43 working days
- Project months (22 working days per month) = 43 ÷ 22 = 1.95 ≈ 2 months core development
